# Three-Maze-Games
A Java Swing project that implements three different maze games, allows the user to try solve 
them and displays a solution reached by a single maze-solver that uses a breadth-first
search algorithm to reach a solution for each of the mazes.

## Numbers Game
When this maze begins, you are on the square at the upper left. What you
have to do is make a series of moves that will take you to the square marked
"Goal." Each square has a number that indicates how far you must move--
horizontally or vertically-- when you leave the square.

## Color Game
Enter by the bottom red path and end on the center gray square.
You may retrace your path but may not make a U-turn on a pathway. You
must follow the paths in the order red, blue, yellow and then red, blue,
yellow again, as needed, changing color on the white squares.

## Pattern Game
You can move horizontally or vertically for any distance, as long as you do
not move over any blank spaces. However, you can only end your move on a
square that has either the same symbol or the same color as the square your
move started on (moving to both the same symbol and the same color is also
okay). You can move straight ahead or to your right or left, but you may not
move to a square that is behind you. If you move to the right or left, your
eyeballs will then be pointing in a new direction.
